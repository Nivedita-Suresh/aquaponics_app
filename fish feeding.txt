
 Basic Logic of Automatic Fish Feeding System


 Objective

To **automatically feed fish at fixed time intervals** in an aquaponic system without human intervention, ensuring uniform feeding and reduced feed wastage.

 Components Involved

* Microcontroller (Arduino / ESP32)
* Servo motor (for feed dispensing)
* Real Time Clock (RTC) module **OR** internal timer
* Power supply

---

## Working Logic (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: System Initialization

* Initialize microcontroller
* Set feeding times (e.g., morning and evening)
* Set servo motor initial position (closed state)

---

### Step 2: Time Monitoring

* Continuously monitor current time using:

  * RTC module **or**
  * Internal delay/timer function

---

### Step 3: Feeding Condition Check

* Compare current time with predefined feeding time

```
IF (current time == feeding time)
    Activate feeder
ELSE
    Keep feeder OFF
```

---

### Step 4: Feed Dispensing

* Rotate servo motor by a fixed angle
* Feed is released into fish tank
* Maintain rotation for a fixed duration (e.g., 2–3 seconds)

---

### Step 5: Reset Feeder

* Rotate servo back to original position
* Stop feeding action

---

### Step 6: Repeat Cycle

* System waits for next feeding time
* Process repeats automatically

---

## Logic in Simple Pseudocode

```
Start
Initialize servo motor
Set feeding times

Loop:
   Read current time
   If time matches feeding time:
       Rotate servo to open feeder
       Delay for feed release
       Rotate servo back to close feeder
   End if
End loop

 
Optional Safety Logic 


If (water level is LOW)
   Skip feeding
If (temperature is HIGH)
   Reduce feeding duration

Key Advantages

* Timely and uniform feeding
* Reduced manual effort
* Prevents overfeeding
* Improves fish health
