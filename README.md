🌱 Smart Aquaponics System – Mini Project

📌 Project Overview

Aquaponics is a sustainable farming technique that combines aquaculture (fish farming) and hydroponics (soil-less plant cultivation). This mini project focuses on designing a smart, automated aquaponics system using sensors, actuators, and a central microcontroller to improve efficiency, monitoring, and control of the ecosystem.

The system automates critical processes such as fish feeding, water circulation, aeration, and environmental monitoring, reducing manual intervention and ensuring optimal conditions for both fish and plants.
